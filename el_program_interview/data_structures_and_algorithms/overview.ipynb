    "* **Primitive types**. know how *int, char, double*, etc. are represented in memory and the primitive operations on them.\n",
    "* **Arrays**. Fast access for element at an index, slow lookups (unless sorted) and insertions. Be comfortable with notions of iteration, resizing, partitioning, merging, etc.\n",
    "* **Strings**. Know how strings are represented in memory. Understand basic operations such as comparison, copying, matching, joining, splitting, etc.\n",
    "* **Lists**. Understand trade-offs with respect to arrays. Be comfortable with iteration, insertion, and deletion within singly and doubly linked lists. Know how to implement a list with dynamic allocation, and with arrays.\n",
    "* **Stacks and queues**. Recognize where last-in first-out (stack) and first-in first-out (queue) semantics are applicable. Know array and linked list implementations. \n",
    "* **Binary trees**. Use for representing hierarchical data. Know about depth, height, leaves, search path, traversal sequences, successor/predecessor operations.\n",
    "* **Heaps**. Key benefit: $O(1)$ lookup find-max, $O(log n)$ insertion, and $O(log n)$ deletion of max. Node and array representations. Min-heap variant.\n",
    "* **Hash tables**. Key benefit: $O(1)$ insertions, deletions and lookups. Key disadvantages: not suitable for order-related queries; need for resizing; poor worst-case performance. Understand implementation using array of buckets and collision chains. Know hash functions for integers, strings, objects.\n",
    "* **Binary search trees**. Key benefit: $O(log n)$ insertions, deletions, lookups, find-min, find-max, successor, predecessor when tree is height-balanced. Understand node fields, pointer implementation. Be familiar with notion of balance, and operations maintaining balance."
